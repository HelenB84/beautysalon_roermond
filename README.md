#React BeautySalon Website
This application can be used for customers who want to lookup prices and make an appointment for a beauty treatment. 
The appointmentform is linked to a Google Firebase Realtime Database, where it stores all the appointment data.

##Background
This is my final assignment for the Frontend of my Bootcamp and also my first project I have made from scratch.
I have made this application for my sister in law who has her own beautysalon and she needed a new website where 
customers can easily see which treatments she offers and also to make an appointment. The appointment data she can lookup
in her own Dashboard.
